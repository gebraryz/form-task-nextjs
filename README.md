# Form Task - Next.js

A minimalistic, aesthetic form with validation built using Next.js, Zod, and shadcn/ui components.

**This was a recruitment task I was asked to complete. Since I put effort into building it and I'm proud of the result, I'm sharing it as open source.**

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 15** (App Router) + TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS 4** + **shadcn/ui** components
